# Instagram Unfollow Tool
Automatically unfollow accounts that don't follow you back on Instagram with Selenium Python üêç.

## Running the code
You must have Python 3 and [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io) installed on your computer. I used Firefox as my chosen browser, which also requires geckodriver.

1) Download [ig_unfollow_tool.py](ig_unfollow_tool.py)
2) Update lines 189-190 with your account credentials 
3) Open terminal and run ```python3 ig_unfollow_tool.py```

Here's what you'll see on screen as the code runs:

<img src="media/login_and_get_followers.gif" width = 500> 
<img src="media/unfollow.gif" width = 500> 

What you'll see in your terminal:

<img src="media/terminal.png" width = 500>
